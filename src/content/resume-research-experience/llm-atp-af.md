cover: ./lean-logo.png
sortIndex: 4
start: August 2024
end: May 2025
location: Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH
advisors:
  - Dr. Aditi Singh
  - Dr. L. Felipe Martins
  - Dr. Shawn D. Ryan
notes:
  - Wrote a methods paper describing a novel framework for proposition autoformalization
  - Built a system integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with the LEAN 4 Proof Assistant (via tool use), enabling the verification of definitions and proofs generated by the LLMs
  - Managed a team of three other Computer Science and Data Science seniors, directing research and engineering efforts.
  - Explored the foundations of formal theorem proving and the LEAN 4 proof language.
