location: Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH
advisors:
  - Dr. Satish Kumar
notes:
  - Critically evaluated a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning technique using cross-validation and extensive hyperparameter tuning.
  - Reproduced the model architecture from scratch using PyTorch and Pennylane.
  - Published findings concluding that the classical-only models perform just as well as models using the hybrid quantum-classical methodology.
